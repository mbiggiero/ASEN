Choose a graph (.xlsx matrix/edgelist, UCINET's DL or pickled NetworkX graph), select the group of indicators and click "Analyze". Files with output will appear in the folder (.txt and .xlsx)

Most of the indicators used are those available in NetworkX, The rest are written from scratch. Please check the complete reference (and preferably the code) before using the results in your research.
