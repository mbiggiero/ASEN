Choose a graph (.xlsx matrix/edgelist, UCINET's DL or pickled NetworkX graph), select the group of indicators and click "Analyze". Output files (.txt and .xlsx) will appear in the folder after the analysis is compelted.

Most of the indicators used are those available in NetworkX, The rest are written from scratch. For the complete list of indicators please check the complete reference (and preferably the code) before using the results in your research.
